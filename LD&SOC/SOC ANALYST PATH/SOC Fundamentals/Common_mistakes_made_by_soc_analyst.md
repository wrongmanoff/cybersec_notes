## Common mistakes: 

## Over-reliance on VirusTotal Results

Sometimes we can rely on the result displayed on VirusTotal’s green  screen after analyzing a file’s URL and seeing that the address is  harmless. However, there is a new malicious software developed using an  AV (AntiVirus) bypass technique that may not be detected by VT  (VirusTotal). For this reason, we should accept VirusTotal as a  supporting tool and perform our analyses with this in mind.

##   Hasty Analysis of Malware in a Sandbox

A 3-4 minute analysis in a sandbox environment may not always yield accurate results. Here are the reasons why:  

Malware might be able to detect a sandbox environment and will not activate itself.

Malware may not become active for 10 to 15 minutes after the operation is performed.

For this reason, the duration of the analysis should be kept as long  as possible and it should take place in a real environment, if possible.

## Inadequate Log Analysis

Occasionally we see that some log analysis is not performed properly. For example, let's say that a piece of malware has been detected on a  machine with the hostname "LetsDefend", and that malware is secretly  sending data to the address "letsdefend.io". As a SOC analyst, you  should use Log Management solutions to determine if any other device is  also attempting to connect to this address.

  

## Overlooking VirusTotal Dates

If the search you performed in VirusTotal has already been queried, a result from the cache will be displayed. For example: We searched the  address "letsdefend.io" in VirusTotal and the result is shown below.

An attacker could simply search a clean URL on VirusTotal and replace it with malicious content. This is why you should not just look at the  search cache, but conduct a new search.
